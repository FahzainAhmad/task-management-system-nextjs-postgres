# Task Management System

## About the Project

This is a full-stack task management system, consisting of both backend and frontend services. The project is built using modern web development technologies and follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the code maintainable and scalable.

### Key Features

#### Backend:
- Developed with **Node.js** and **Express** for server-side logic.
- **Sequelize ORM** with **PostgreSQL** as the database for efficient data handling.
- Built using **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions.
- Implements **validations** and **error handling** to ensure robust functionality.
- Supports **pagination** and **filtering** for efficient data retrieval.
  

#### Frontend:
- Data fetching using **Axios**.
- **LocalStorage** for token management.
- **Authorization** for secure API requests.
- **Validations** and **error handling** for forms and API requests.
- Task management features: showing, creating, updating, deleting.
- **Pagination** and **filtering** for efficient data retrieval.
- Handling token expiration.
- TypeScript types used for type safety.
- **Responsive design** for seamless user experience across devices.
